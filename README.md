# Opsbrew {docsify-ignore}

> Opsbrew is a pipeline-as-a-service solution that can act as an universal router, receiver and collector of observability data with just one click. At the core of this solution we have the Opsbrew Engine, capable of log transformation (filtering, third party API enrichment, PII masking, automated parsing), log retention and event taxonomy of logs.
