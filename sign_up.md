# Getting Started

This provides information to get you up and running with Opsbrew pipelines.  Opsbrew is a logging-as-a-service solution. All it takes is one click and Opsbrew’s ingestion engine pre-processes logs from multiple distributed sources and routes them to multiple distributed destinations.

We show how to use Opsbrew  and how to create organization, landscape, environment, pipeline, alerts etc. If you are visiting our platform for the first time, a sign-up page will appear to create your Opsbrew account.
